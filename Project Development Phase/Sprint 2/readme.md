SPRINT 2: 

1. The correlation values for each feature was obtained and the top 12 features were used for training.
2. Models used:
   
         a. Support Vector Machine Classifier
         b. Decision Trees
         c. Logistic Regressor
         d. K Nearest Neighbors Method
         e. RNN-LSTM

Highest accuracy was obtained while using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
