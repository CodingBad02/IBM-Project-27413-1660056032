SPRINT 2: 

In the second sprint of the project, the team focussed on further analysis of the dataset. We performed basic graphical anaysis on the dataset. 

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

      1. The correlation values for each feature was obtained and the top 12 features were used for training.
      
      2. Models used:

                  a. Support Vector Machine Classifier

                  b. Decision Trees

                  c. Logistic Regressor

                  d. K Nearest Neighbors Method

                  e. RNN-LSTM

      3. Highest accuracy was obtained while using the Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
