Web Phishing Detection
Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels.

Typically a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or organization. The message contains malicious software targeting the user’s computer or has links to direct victims to malicious websites in order to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.

Phishing is popular among attackers, since it is easier to trick someone into clicking a malicious link which seems legitimate than trying to break through a computer’s defense systems. The malicious links within the body of the message are designed to make it appear that they go to the spoofed organization using that organization’s logos and other legitimate contents.
